This code first takes a string input from the user using the Scanner class. 
Then it calls the reverse method to reverse the string. 
The reverse method creates a new character array with the same length as the input string, 
then it fills this array in reverse order with the characters of the input string. 
Finally, it converts the character array back to a string and returns it.
